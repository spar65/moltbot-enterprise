description: Separate VIBEcoder documentation from AgentMinder features to maintain clear boundaries
globs: "FEATURES/**, documentation-portal/**"
___

# Feature and Documentation Separation

This rule establishes clear boundaries between VIBEcoder™ product documentation and AgentMinder application features.

## Context

- The repository contains two distinct sets of features:
  1. VIBEcoder™ product features (the documentation system itself)
  2. AgentMinder application features (the application being documented)
- Without clear separation, these can be confused and incorrectly placed

## Requirements

### Directory Structure Separation

- **VIBEcoder™ Product Documentation**:
  - MUST be located in `documentation-portal/pages/features/`
  - Documents the capabilities of the VIBEcoder™ documentation system itself
  - Includes features like code visualization, search, and interactive documentation

- **AgentMinder Application Features**:
  - MUST be located in `FEATURES/`
  - Documents the features of the AgentMinder application
  - Includes platform user features, super user features, admin features, etc.
  - MUST follow this exact directory structure:
    - `FEATURES/features/` - Feature documentation files
    - `FEATURES/interface/` - API and interface documentation
    - `FEATURES/user-stories/` - User story documentation

### Prohibited Directories

- The following directories MUST NOT exist:
  - `FEATURES/use-cases/` - Use cases should be documented elsewhere
  - `FEATURES/agentminder/` - Features should not be in a subdirectory
  - `FEATURES/vibecoder/` - VIBEcoder documentation belongs in documentation-portal
  - Any other top-level directories in FEATURES besides features, interface, and user-stories

### Content Guidelines

- VIBEcoder™ documentation MUST focus on the documentation system's capabilities
- AgentMinder features MUST focus on the application being built
- Content should never be duplicated between these directories
- Reference the other system only when necessary and with clear distinction

### Naming Conventions

- VIBEcoder™ documentation files should contain terms like "documentation", "visualization", "portal"
- AgentMinder features should contain terms like "platform", "organization", "users", "agents"

## Examples

<example>
// VIBEcoder™ feature belongs in documentation-portal
```markdown
# Code Visualization

Code Visualization is a core feature of VIBEcoder™ that transforms complex code relationships 
into intuitive, interactive diagrams...
```

// AgentMinder feature belongs in FEATURES/features
```markdown
# AI Agent Management

The AI Agent management workflow consists of a comprehensive process including Setup, Test, 
and Deploy stages with a robust template-based configuration system...
```

// AgentMinder API belongs in FEATURES/interface
```markdown
# Agent API Endpoints

This document details the REST API endpoints available for managing AI agents...
```

// AgentMinder user stories belong in FEATURES/user-stories
```markdown
# Super User Stories

This document lists all user stories for the Super User role...
```
</example>

<example type="invalid">
// WRONG: VIBEcoder feature incorrectly placed in AgentMinder features directory
```
FEATURES/documentation-visualization.md  // Should be in documentation-portal/pages/features/
```

// WRONG: AgentMinder feature incorrectly placed in VIBEcoder documentation
```
documentation-portal/pages/features/agent-management.md  // Should be in FEATURES/features/
```

// WRONG: Feature placed in incorrect AgentMinder subdirectory
```
FEATURES/agentminder/features/platform-dashboard.md  // Should be in FEATURES/features/
```

// WRONG: Feature placed in prohibited directory
```
FEATURES/use-cases/agent-deployment.md  // Use cases should not be in FEATURES/
```
</example>

## Checking for Compliance

- Before committing changes, verify files are in the correct location
- When using the `codebase_search` tool, specify the correct target directory based on what you're searching for
- When syncing documentation, ensure the correct source/target mapping
- Run `./documentation-portal/run-portal.sh` regularly to check for and fix structural issues
