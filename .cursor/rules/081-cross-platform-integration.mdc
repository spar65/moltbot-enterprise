# Cross-Platform Integration Standards

## Data Synchronization

- Implement bidirectional data synchronization between email platform and other systems
- Apply consistent field mapping across all integrated platforms
- Create conflict resolution protocols for data inconsistencies
- Implement real-time synchronization for critical customer data
- Document data flow diagrams for all integration points
- Apply proper error handling for synchronization failures

## Customer Identity Resolution

- Implement unified customer identification across platforms
- Create primary and secondary identity resolution methods
- Apply deterministic and probabilistic matching techniques
- Implement proper privacy controls for identity resolution
- Document identity resolution logic and success rates
- Create fallback mechanisms for unresolved identities

## Event Handling

- Implement standardized event schema across platforms
- Create centralized event collection and distribution
- Apply consistent event naming conventions
- Implement event validation and sanitization
- Document event taxonomy for cross-platform actions
- Create event handling failure recovery mechanisms

## Unified Segmentation

- Create segments that incorporate data from multiple sources
- Implement segment synchronization across platforms
- Apply consistent segment naming conventions
- Document segment qualification criteria across systems
- Create segment membership reconciliation processes
- Implement segment analytics across platforms

## Testing and Monitoring

- Create comprehensive integration test suites
- Implement real-time monitoring of integration points
- Apply alerting for integration failures or anomalies
- Create integration health dashboards
- Document integration failure recovery procedures
- Implement periodic integration verification processes

- **`.cursor/tools/test-integration-sync.sh`** - Test cross-platform data sync
  ```bash
  ./.cursor/tools/test-integration-sync.sh --system mailchimp
  # Tests: Data sync, identity resolution, event handling
  ```

### Quick Start - Cross-Platform Integration

```bash
# 1. Define unified customer schema
# Map fields across all platforms (email, CRM, product, etc.)

# 2. Implement identity resolution
# Create primary key (email) and secondary keys (user_id, customer_id)

# 3. Set up bidirectional sync
# Email platform ↔ CRM ↔ Product ↔ Analytics

# 4. Implement event taxonomy
# Standardize event names across all systems

# 5. Create unified segments
# Combine data from multiple sources for targeting

# 6. Monitor integration health
# Set up alerts for sync failures, identity mismatches
```

### Key Differences from Email-Specific Rules

**This rule (081)** focuses on:

- ✅ **Cross-system** customer identity (not just email)
- ✅ **Multi-platform** data synchronization (CRM + Email + Product + Analytics)
- ✅ **Unified segmentation** (combining data from all sources)
- ✅ **Standardized events** across all platforms

**Email-specific rules** (076, etc.) focus on:

- ✅ **Email platform only** (MailChimp, SendGrid, etc.)
- ✅ **Email-specific features** (templates, campaigns, lists)
- ✅ **Email deliverability** (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
- ✅ **Email compliance** (GDPR, CAN-SPAM, CASL)

**Use both together** for complete email marketing infrastructure!
