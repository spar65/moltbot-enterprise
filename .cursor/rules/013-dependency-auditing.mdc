# Dependency Security Auditing

## Context
- Third-party dependencies make up a significant portion of modern applications
- Vulnerabilities in dependencies can create security risks in your application
- New vulnerabilities are discovered regularly, requiring ongoing vigilance
- Dependency updates must be carefully managed to balance security and stability
- Different package managers and languages have their own auditing tools

## Requirements

### Pre-Deployment Security Audits
- **REQUIRED**: Run dependency security audits before all deployments
- **REQUIRED**: Address all high and critical severity vulnerabilities before deployment
- Document any security exceptions with clear justification and remediation plan
- Include dependency auditing in CI/CD pipelines as a required step
- Set up alerts for newly discovered vulnerabilities in your dependencies

```bash
# Node.js projects - npm
npm audit

# To fix automatically where possible
npm audit fix

# For situations where breaking changes might occur
npm audit fix --force  # Use with caution

# Node.js projects - yarn
yarn audit

# Node.js projects - pnpm
pnpm audit

# Python projects
pip-audit

# Ruby projects
bundle audit
```

### Vulnerability Management

- Prioritize vulnerabilities based on severity, exploitability, and business impact
- Create action plans for addressing vulnerabilities that cannot be immediately fixed
- Document deliberate decisions to accept certain vulnerability risks
- Set time limits for temporary exceptions (e.g., "fix within 2 weeks")
- Consider the application context when evaluating vulnerabilities
- For vulnerabilities in development dependencies, assess if they affect your deployment

```typescript
// Example vulnerability exception documentation
/**
 * VULNERABILITY EXCEPTION
 * 
 * Package: example-package@1.2.3
 * CVE: CVE-2023-12345
 * Severity: High
 * 
 * Exception Reason:
 * This vulnerability affects the server-side rendering functionality which we do not use
 * in our application. We use this package only for client-side data formatting.
 * 
 * Mitigation:
 * We have implemented input validation before passing data to this package.
 * 
 * Plan:
 * - Monitor for package update that fixes this issue
 * - Update by: 2023-12-31
 * - Owner: Security Team
 */
```

### Automated Security Scanning

- Set up automated tools for continuous dependency scanning (Snyk, Dependabot, etc.)
- Configure automated PRs for security updates
- Use lockfiles to ensure dependency consistency across environments
- Include security scanning in your PR review process
- Run deeper security scans on a regular schedule (weekly/monthly)
- Scan for vulnerabilities in direct and transitive dependencies

```yaml
# Example GitHub Dependabot configuration
# .github/dependabot.yml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "npm" # or yarn, pip, composer, etc.
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    # Focus on security updates
    open-pull-requests-limit: 10
    labels:
      - "dependencies"
      - "security"
    # Group minor updates to reduce PR noise
    groups:
      development-dependencies:
        patterns:
          - "eslint*"
          - "jest*"
          - "@types/*"
      production-dependencies:
        patterns:
          - "react*"
          - "next*"
```

### Update Strategy

- Maintain a clear dependency update strategy (e.g., regular updates vs. security-only)
- Schedule regular non-security dependency updates to prevent technical debt
- Test thoroughly after security-related dependency updates
- Plan for major version upgrades that include breaking changes
- Document your dependency review and update process
- Consider using tools like npm-check or npm-check-updates to identify outdated packages

```bash
# Identify outdated packages
npm outdated

# Use specialized tools for managing updates
npx npm-check-updates

# Update to latest versions with review
npx npm-check-updates -u
npm install

# Update specific packages only
npm update package-name
```

### Dependency Minimization

- Regularly review and prune unnecessary dependencies
- Consider the security implications before adding new dependencies
- Evaluate the activity and maintenance status of dependencies before adoption
- Check dependency sizes and their impact on your application bundle
- Consider vendoring small, critical dependencies if they have security issues
- Avoid dependencies with excessive nested dependencies

```bash
# Analyze your bundle size including dependencies
npx webpack-bundle-analyzer

# Find duplicate packages in your dependency tree
npx depcheck

# Identify potential dependency issues
npx madge --circular .
```

### Language-Specific Requirements

#### Node.js / npm / yarn
- Always use lockfiles (package-lock.json, yarn.lock, pnpm-lock.yaml)
- Consider using npm ci instead of npm install in CI/CD for consistent installs
- Use npm audit --omit=dev in production contexts where appropriate

```bash
# Production audit only (npm)
npm audit --omit=dev

# Install exact versions to prevent unexpected updates
npm install --save-exact package-name
```

#### Python
- Use virtual environments to isolate dependencies
- Consider tools like pip-audit, safety, or pipenv check
- Use requirements.txt or Pipfile.lock to lock dependencies

```bash
# Python audit tools
pip install pip-audit
pip-audit

# Alternative tools
pip install safety
safety check
```

#### Ruby
- Use bundle audit to check for vulnerabilities
- Keep Gemfile.lock in version control
- Use bundle update --conservative for safer updates
