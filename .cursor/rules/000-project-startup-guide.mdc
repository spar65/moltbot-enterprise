# Project Startup Guide

## Context

Starting a new project requires careful planning across multiple dimensions: tech stack selection, comprehensive documentation, workflow setup, and implementation planning. This guide orchestrates all project startup rules into a cohesive, proven sequence that transforms initial concepts into production-ready specifications.

**When properly followed, this system**:

- Reduces initial planning from weeks to days
- Prevents architectural rework (saves 40-80 hours)
- Enables immediate development with clear specs
- Provides stakeholder-ready documentation
- Establishes development workflow from day one

## Requirements

### When to Use This Guide

**✅ Use this startup guide when**:

- **REQUIRED**: Starting a completely new project (greenfield development)
- **REQUIRED**: Major feature requiring comprehensive specs (20+ hours development)
- **REQUIRED**: Project requiring stakeholder buy-in and approval
- **REQUIRED**: Project with multiple developers or team collaboration
- Building MVP for new product or service
- Creating proof-of-concept requiring full documentation

**❌ Do NOT use this guide when**:

- Adding features to existing, well-documented projects
- Day-to-day development and maintenance
- Bug fixes or minor enhancements
- Quick prototypes or experiments (< 20 hours)
- Scripts, utilities, or throwaway code
- Projects with existing comprehensive documentation

### The 4-Phase Startup Sequence

This guide orchestrates project startup through four sequential phases. Each phase builds on the previous, creating a comprehensive foundation for development.

**Total Time Investment**: 8-13 hours  
**Time Saved During Development**: 70-135 hours  
**ROI**: 5-10x return on investment

---

## Phase 1: Tech Stack Selection (30-60 minutes)

### Purpose

Select optimal technology stack based on project requirements, team skills, budget, timeline, and scale needs.

### Process

**Step 1: Gather Requirements** (10 minutes)

```markdown
Document:

- Application type (web app, mobile, API, etc.)
- Expected scale (users, data volume, traffic)
- Team skills and experience
- Budget constraints (development and production)
- Timeline requirements
- Compliance needs (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
```

**Step 2: Apply Decision Framework** (20-40 minutes)

Use **@900-tech-stack-selection.mdc** to:

**Step 2: Generate 15 Documents** (4-6 hours)

Follow **@801-project-documentation-structure.mdc** for document structure.

Use **@802-ai-documentation-generation.mdc** for AI-assisted generation.

**Document Generation Order** (CRITICAL - Do not skip ahead):

**Foundation (00-04)** - 2-3 hours:

1. `00-UserStories-MASTER.md` - 25-30 user stories organized by epics
2. `01-project-overview.md` - Executive summary and project charter
3. `02-tech-stack-architecture.md` - Technology decisions with detailed rationale
4. `03-database-schema.md` - Complete database design with Prisma schema
5. `04-user-stories-requirements.md` - Detailed technical requirements

**Technical Specs (05-09)** - 2-3 hours: 6. `05-ui-ux-design-specs.md` - Design system with code examples 7. `06-component-library-guide.md` - Component catalog with props 8. `07-data-structure.md` - Core content/data schema 9. `08-api-endpoints-specification.md` - Complete API documentation 10. `09-security-privacy-considerations.md` - Security measures and compliance

**Quality & Operations (10-14)** - 1-2 hours: 11. `10-testing-strategy.md` - Testing approach with examples 12. `11-deployment-configuration.md` - Deployment guide 13. `12-development-workflow.md` - Git workflow and code standards 14. `13-pwa-implementation.md` - PWA features (optional) 15. `14-implementation-roadmap.md` - Phased development plan

## Common Pitfalls

### ❌ Rushing Through Documentation (Phase 2)

**Symptoms**: Thin documents, missing details, generic content, placeholders

**Prevention**:

- Allocate full 5-8 hours for Phase 2
- Review each document for 15+ minutes before proceeding
- Use AI refinement prompts when output is generic
- Run all 4 validation prompts

**Impact if Skipped**: 40-80 hours wasted on rework during development

### ❌ Skipping Tech Stack Justification (Phase 1)

**Symptoms**: Tech choices questioned later, wrong tools for scale, costly migrations

**Prevention**:

- Document rationale for every major decision
- Compare alternatives with specific criteria
- Consider total cost of ownership
- Get stakeholder buy-in on decisions

**Impact if Skipped**: 10-30 hours on tech stack changes or migrations

### ❌ Not Setting Up Workflow (Phase 3)

**Symptoms**: Inconsistent commits, merge conflicts, unclear process, deployment issues

**Prevention**:

- Configure Git workflow before first feature
- Set up CI/CD early
- Document and communicate process
- Use PR templates and review checklists

**Impact if Skipped**: 5-15 hours on workflow friction and coordination

### ❌ Starting Development Without Phase 4 Plan

**Symptoms**: Unclear priorities, missed dependencies, timeline slips, scope creep

**Prevention**:

- Break roadmap into actionable phases
- Identify dependencies explicitly
- Set clear milestones and success criteria
- Track progress from day one

**Impact if Skipped**: 10-20 hours on replanning and coordination

### ❌ Treating Documentation as Static

**Symptoms**: Specs drift from implementation, confusion, duplicate work

**Prevention**:

- Update docs when requirements change
- Review specs during PRs for accuracy
- Version documentation with code
- Schedule quarterly doc reviews

**Impact if Skipped**: Documentation becomes obsolete, loses value
